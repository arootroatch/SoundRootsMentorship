        I'm Alex Root-Roatch. I'm the owner of Sound Roots Productions, a
        production company that provides a full-service production to staff to
        bars and clubs, from providing sound engineers to installing and
        programming lighting and audio rigs. I have a Bachelor's of Music in
        Recording Technology and 10 years of live audio engineering experience.
        Before Sound Roots Productions, I worked at a large production company
        called VER (now PRG), where I assembled and prepped the audio systems
        for large tours like:

          <li >...and many more!</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>
        I've been blessed to personally have run sound for many great artists,
        including:
      </p>
      <div className='ulWrapper'>
        <ul>
          <li>Ashley McBryde</li>
          <li >Kacey Musgraves</li>
          <li >The Brummies</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li >LA Guns</li>
          <li >Tom Keifer</li>
          <li >Lucie Silvas</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>
        As the owner of Sound Roots Productions, I hire, train, and schedule
        audio engineers for 5 venues. In my 5 years running the company, I've
        noticed that the students from large University audio programs are some
        of the least gig-ready job applicants. I found myself devising training
        programs to get these students' skills up to snuff as quickly as
        possible through hands-on experience and focused exercises that targeted
        the skills they needed to improve. It was then that I realized that
        there was a better way to do live audio education than what college
        programs were offering.
